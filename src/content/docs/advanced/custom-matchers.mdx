Latte provides a powerful way to create custom matchers, allowing you to extend the functionality of the built-in matchers to suit your specific testing needs. 

This is particularly useful when you want to encapsulate complex assertions or when you want to create reusable matchers for your test suite.

## Creating a Custom Matcher
If you miss the built-in matchers, you can easily create your own by extending an instance of Expect.

To create a custom matcher, you can extend `Expect` class.

```js
import {Expect} from "@olton/latte";

class MyExpect extends Expect {
    toBeEven() {
        let received = this.received
        let result = received % 2 === 0

        // this required for not modifier
        result = result === this.control; 

        if (!result) {
            this.message = `Expected ${received} to be even`
        }
    }
}

const expect = (received) => new MyExpect(received)

test(`Custom expect`, () => {
    expect(2).toBeEven()
})

test(`Custom expect`, () => {
    expect(3).not.toBeEven()
})
```
